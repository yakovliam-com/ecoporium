## About Ecoporium
Ecoporium is a Minecraft Plugin designed to synchronize real-world stock and cryptocurrency markets with in-game currency through [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault). Every few minutes, the in-game values will update based on the [YahooFinance-API by sstrickx](https://github.com/sstrickx/yahoofinance-api), and players will have the opportunity to buy and sell with the new prices.

### Is Ecoporium a good choice for me?
Ecoporium is a very unique plugin because the real world has full control over the nitty-gritty values that you'd normally have to tweak ever so carefully to create a good economy, and it's dynamic. Please be aware that although a dynamic market is realistic, sometimes it can get out of hand in a controlled environment.

Using a real-world-market in a controlled environment can cause unforseen economic stress as like in real life, someone could very well become a millionaire overnight.
